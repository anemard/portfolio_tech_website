# portfolio_tech_website

## Description:
This is the first portfolio I've made. Featuring finished creative projects made up to the end of May 2023. This is a React.js porfolio website project that uses custom CSS Styling and includes FontAwesome icons and is hosted on HostGator. The project also includes a custom API call from Native Lands (https://native-land.ca/resources/api-docs/) as part of my land acknowledgement. This API call displays a map of the Indigenous people that have claims to the Chicagoland area, where I reside.
