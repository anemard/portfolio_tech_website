        <p>Hi! My name is An Emard. I graduated with a Masters in Fine Art from Northwestern University in 2022. Soon after, I found my passion for programming because it allows me to integrate my visual arts background while continuing to challenge me. So I enrolled at Fullstack Academy, a premier coding bootcamp and the rest was history. When I'm not coding, I love to paint, hike, and try new restaurants.</p>
