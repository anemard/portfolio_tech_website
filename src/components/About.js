        <p>An Emard graduated with a Masters in Fine Art from Northwestern University in 2022. Soon after, they found a passion for programming which allows the integration of their visual arts background into the challenging world of code. Emard enrolled in Fullstack Academy, a premier coding bootcamp, and the rest is history. When they are not coding, they love to make art, hike, and try new restaurants.</p>
